Operators ignore alerts when they feel generic. To build predictive maintenance models that stick, we blend historian data, PLC tags, and shift notes into the feature set.

Models stay explainable by logging which signals drove each prediction and surfacing counterfactuals. Maintenance teams review false positives weekly, tuning guardbands instead of disabling the system.

Rolling out looks like this:

1. Short discovery to map sensors and maintenance workflows.
2. Baseline models with clear precision/recall targets and acceptance gates.
3. Shadow deployment that emails the maintenance lead for manual confirmation before automatic triggers go live.

Trust grows because the assistant shows why it cares, and teams close the loop with simple feedback tools.
