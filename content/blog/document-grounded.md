When an operator asks a question, they have to trust both the answer and the citation. "Document-grounded" means the response is built from your controlled content — SOPs, manuals, HACCP plans, SDS/TDS sheets, customer specs, and audit logs.

We ingest and normalise those sources, map them to machines, lines, and SKUs, then use retrieval augmented generation (RAG) with a knowledge graph to assemble a cited answer.

Every response carries:

- The exact passage that informed the answer.
- A link back to the authoritative file at the right page or timestamp.
- Metadata about who asked, which sources were consulted, and how the assistant scored confidence.

Without citations, trust erodes. With them, audits calm down and cross-shift knowledge stays accessible.
