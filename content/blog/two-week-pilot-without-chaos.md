Pilots collapse when scope creeps. We keep things calm with a fixed sprint structure:

- **Day 1–2:** Kickoff, line walkthrough, document drop, sensor export.
- **Day 3–6:** Ingestion and schema linking. Daily check-ins keep content flowing.
- **Day 7–10:** Model tuning. We track three metrics — time-to-answer, citation accuracy, and operator confidence.
- **Day 11–14:** Shadow run with operators, KPI review, and go/no-go recommendations.

Every deliverable sits in a shared workspace with access controls. At day 14 you get a clear ROI model and a plan to productionise without starting from scratch.
